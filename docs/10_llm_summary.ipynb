      "\n",
      "The publications provide insights into various aspects of brain function and its interactions with acoustic signals, revealing distinct areas of specialization within the auditory cortex while also highlighting regions involved in higher-level processes such as phonological representation and emotional processing. They collectively emphasize hierarchical organization within the auditory system, lateralization effects, and neural plasticity following cochlear implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 1: Sensory Encoding of Acoustic Effect of Vocal Tract Length\n",
      "\n",
      "This study investigates how humans perceive the acoustic effect of vocal tract length (VTL), which reflects size information based on sound production. A mechanism involving a time-stabilized spectral scaling is proposed as the neural correlate for processing this sensory cue, with evidence pointing to the MGB and non-primary auditory cortex in planum temporale and anterior superior temporal gyrus being involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 2: Cortical Dynamics of Acoustic and Phonological Processing\n",
      "\n",
      "This research supports the hierarchical model of auditory-phonological processing by showing that core auditory regions are sensitive to basic acoustic features, while downstream regions like left middle MTG respond to abstract phonological representations. The study also indicates modulation of low-level acoustic analysis by high-level phonological information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 3: Preference for Audiovisual Speech Congruency\n",
      "\n",
      "This work demonstrates preference in superior temporal cortex (STC) for audiovisual speech congruence, indicating that this area prefers simultaneous auditory and visual input supporting the same representation. This study offers evidence for a more complex interplay between low-level acoustic processing and high-level phonological representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 4: Hierarchical Organization of Auditory Cortex\n",
      "\n",
      "This investigation supports hierarchical organization in human auditory cortex by showing higher sensitivity to acoustic variation within intelligible speech regions compared to unintelligible speech. The anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) were found more sensitive to whether speech was intelligible, reflecting the processing at different levels of abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 5: Hemispheric Specialization for Auditory Nonspeech Stimuli\n",
      "\n",
      "This study reveals asymmetries in auditory processing between hemispheres, particularly in temporal and spectral domains. Increased variation in either domain evokes activity primarily in left hemisphere regions (Heschl's gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus) for temporal modulation and right hemisphere regions (superior temporal gyrus and anterior superior temporal sulcus) for spectral modulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 6: Neural Basis of Auditory Expectation\n",
      "\n",
      "This study investigates the processing of unexpected sounds using fMRI, revealing increased activity in left temporal and insular cortices compared to expected sounds. The left middle temporal gyrus shows greater activation regardless of whether it is sounds or silence that are unexpected, suggesting involvement in auditory expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 7: Cortical Plasticity After Cochlear Implantation\n",
      "\n",
      "This investigation finds differential brain activity between pre- and postlingual hearing loss patients following cochlear implant (CI) surgery. Broca's area becomes active only for CI recipients with postlingual hearing loss, indicating that the left hemisphere is more involved in speech perception after language acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 8: Neural Dynamics of Whispering\n",
      "\n",
      "This study quantifies the reduced information content of whispered voices and finds compensatory activation in auditory-frontal brain networks. Recognizing socio-affective cues from whispers requires additional processing resources compared to normal voice sounds, highlighting the challenge of deciphering meaning through altered sound quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 9: Altered Connectivity due to Infrasound\n",
      "\n",
      "This investigation reveals changes in local connectivity within the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right amygdala during exposure to near-threshold infrasound (IS). These changes suggest compensation for reduced sound quality but also raise concerns about potential pathogenic effects from prolonged exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Publication 10: Bilateral Reorganization of Posterior Temporal Cortices in Post-Lingual Deafness\n",
      "\n",
      "This research shows that the right posterior superior temporal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (PSTG/SMG) is abnormally active in post-lingual deafness, with compensatory responses in left PSTG/SMG for phonological processing. This reorganization suggests a specific takeover of the right hemisphere by phonological processing due to communication relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Synthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "These studies collectively support hierarchical organization within auditory cortex and highlight regional specialization and plastic changes following different conditions such as hearing loss or cochlear implantation. They also underscore the role of lateralization effects and compensation mechanisms in adapting to altered acoustic signals. However, there are areas of conflicting findings regarding specific regions' roles and the extent of compensatory activity, necessitating further research to reconcile these divergent results.\n"

       "\"### Overview\\n\\nThe publications provide insights into various aspects of brain function and its interactions with acoustic signals, revealing distinct areas of specialization within the auditory cortex while also highlighting regions involved in higher-level processes such as phonological representation and emotional processing. They collectively emphasize hierarchical organization within the auditory system, lateralization effects, and neural plasticity following cochlear implantation.\\n\\n### Publication 1: Sensory Encoding of Acoustic Effect of Vocal Tract Length\\n\\nThis study investigates how humans perceive the acoustic effect of vocal tract length (VTL), which reflects size information based on sound production. A mechanism involving a time-stabilized spectral scaling is proposed as the neural correlate for processing this sensory cue, with evidence pointing to the MGB and non-primary auditory cortex in planum temporale and anterior superior temporal gyrus being involved.\\n\\n### Publication 2: Cortical Dynamics of Acoustic and Phonological Processing\\n\\nThis research supports the hierarchical model of auditory-phonological processing by showing that core auditory regions are sensitive to basic acoustic features, while downstream regions like left middle MTG respond to abstract phonological representations. The study also indicates modulation of low-level acoustic analysis by high-level phonological information.\\n\\n### Publication 3: Preference for Audiovisual Speech Congruency\\n\\nThis work demonstrates preference in superior temporal cortex (STC) for audiovisual speech congruence, indicating that this area prefers simultaneous auditory and visual input supporting the same representation. This study offers evidence for a more complex interplay between low-level acoustic processing and high-level phonological representations.\\n\\n### Publication 4: Hierarchical Organization of Auditory Cortex\\n\\nThis investigation supports hierarchical organization in human auditory cortex by showing higher sensitivity to acoustic variation within intelligible speech regions compared to unintelligible speech. The anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) were found more sensitive to whether speech was intelligible, reflecting the processing at different levels of abstraction.\\n\\n### Publication 5: Hemispheric Specialization for Auditory Nonspeech Stimuli\\n\\nThis study reveals asymmetries in auditory processing between hemispheres, particularly in temporal and spectral domains. Increased variation in either domain evokes activity primarily in left hemisphere regions (Heschl's gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus) for temporal modulation and right hemisphere regions (superior temporal gyrus and anterior superior temporal sulcus) for spectral modulation.\\n\\n### Publication 6: Neural Basis of Auditory Expectation\\n\\nThis study investigates the processing of unexpected sounds using fMRI, revealing increased activity in left temporal and insular cortices compared to expected sounds. The left middle temporal gyrus shows greater activation regardless of whether it is sounds or silence that are unexpected, suggesting involvement in auditory expectation.\\n\\n### Publication 7: Cortical Plasticity After Cochlear Implantation\\n\\nThis investigation finds differential brain activity between pre- and postlingual hearing loss patients following cochlear implant (CI) surgery. Broca's area becomes active only for CI recipients with postlingual hearing loss, indicating that the left hemisphere is more involved in speech perception after language acquisition.\\n\\n### Publication 8: Neural Dynamics of Whispering\\n\\nThis study quantifies the reduced information content of whispered voices and finds compensatory activation in auditory-frontal brain networks. Recognizing socio-affective cues from whispers requires additional processing resources compared to normal voice sounds, highlighting the challenge of deciphering meaning through altered sound quality.\\n\\n### Publication 9: Altered Connectivity due to Infrasound\\n\\nThis investigation reveals changes in local connectivity within the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right amygdala during exposure to near-threshold infrasound (IS). These changes suggest compensation for reduced sound quality but also raise concerns about potential pathogenic effects from prolonged exposure.\\n\\n### Publication 10: Bilateral Reorganization of Posterior Temporal Cortices in Post-Lingual Deafness\\n\\nThis research shows that the right posterior superior temporal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (PSTG/SMG) is abnormally active in post-lingual deafness, with compensatory responses in left PSTG/SMG for phonological processing. This reorganization suggests a specific takeover of the right hemisphere by phonological processing due to communication relevance.\\n\\n### Synthesis\\n\\nThese studies collectively support hierarchical organization within auditory cortex and highlight regional specialization and plastic changes following different conditions such as hearing loss or cochlear implantation. They also underscore the role of lateralization effects and compensation mechanisms in adapting to altered acoustic signals. However, there are areas of conflicting findings regarding specific regions' roles and the extent of compensatory activity, necessitating further research to reconcile these divergent results.\""
